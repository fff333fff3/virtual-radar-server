        // test of 25 hours of network packets all sent consecutively the Set call accounted for a third
        // of the packet processing time. So now the foreground thread queues the items and the background
        // thread spins, polling the queue and immediately surrendering its timeslice when the queue is
        // empty. In testing this had no discernable affect on CPU usage and improved the throughput of
        // messages enormously, previously it would take ~1 minute 40 seconds to process 113Mb of network
        // packets, after switching to the spinning & polling mechanism this was reduced to ~45 seconds.
